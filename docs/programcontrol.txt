Testing will begin with checking that the command line interface can handle running with no arguments and when requesting
a file. Once we have checked that it can run with these arguments we will begin testing calling the file reader.
This will entail checking that a no argument run returns a list of files, and running with a file name properly handles
checking the file exists and, if so, reading and returning it.
The psuedocode for connecting the command line and file reader are as follows:

check length of args list called from command line class

if length == 0
    call file reader class with arguments no files to read
else
    call file reader class with file name as argument
