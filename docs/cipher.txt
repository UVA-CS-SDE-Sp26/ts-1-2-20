Deciphered: abcdefghijklmnopqurstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQURSTUVWXYZ1234567890
Ciphered text: bcdefghijklmnopqurstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQURSTUVWXYZ1234567890a

The text/string will be ciphered according to line 4 and my code will decipher it to line 3.
I can use the ciphered string as the key to deciphering the code by going back one character.

String == 'abcdefghijklmnopqurstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQURSTUVWXYZ1234567890'
Get ciphered string
Loop through the ciphered string
if character in ciphered string == 'char' 
  find that char index in ciphered string
  go back by one to get deciphered char
keep looping through until string is deciphered
construct new string with the deciphered chars
return new string

if any chars don't match any of the chars in the key string, then it is whitespace so just keep it.

Only problem is wrapping to end, if deciphered string is a then it needs to be 0.
Can wrap around to get length - 1 index or use an if statement, so if the deciphered char is a, make it 0
